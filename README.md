# Reading List
### As part of my personal/portfolio website, this page displays my favorite books per genre.

The visitors will be able to click a category, this will request data from the corresponding Book Shelf on Google Books.
An image slider will allow the user to navigate through each book on the bookshelf.
The slider shows the bookcover, author, title and short description; all from the Google Books API request.
The description section is clickable, and will link to the Google Books page for this book.
The image slider is responsive, scaling down with screen size, and has a breakpoint to collapse vertically for mobile phone screens.
